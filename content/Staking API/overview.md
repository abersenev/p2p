# Overview

The Staking API allows you to initiate staking requests seamlessly.

The Staking API allows you to integrate your systems with our validators' infrastructure. You can initiate staking requests and retrieve staking position data without relying on dedicated web page forms. By integrating with our Staking API, offering staking services to your customers becomes significantly easier.

With the Staking API, you will receive:

- Access to the P2P validator infrastructure, which is consistently ranked among the top-performing validators.
- Customer-oriented support through a dedicated channel with our team of developers.
- The ability to configure your node by selecting the location, MEV relay, and regulatory entity (in development).

The basic information about the interaction with the Staking API is shown in the picture below.
