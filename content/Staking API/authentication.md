# Authentication

Retrieve your authentication token

Our Staking API relies on the use of secure tokens. Each client will be provided with a unique authentication token that provides secure access to our services.

As we are currently in the process of developing an API interface for retrieving these tokens, the process to obtain them is currently manual. You can follow the steps below to retrieve your authentication token:

1. **Contact Our Product Team:**

	At this stage, the Product team is responsible for manually generating your authentication token. Please send an email to our Product team at alessandro.maci@p2p.org. In your communication, provide your account details (the company name for example) and mention that you need an authentication token.

2. **Using Your Authentication Token:**

	Once you receive your token, you can use it to authenticate your account and access our services. 

Please note that this is a temporary process. We are diligently working to develop an automated interface that will allow you to retrieve your authentication tokens independently. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this time.

If you encounter any problems or have any questions during this process, please contact us using the [Contacts]({{< relref "Support/contacts" >}}) page.
