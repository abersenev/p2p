# Introduction

Our Liquid Staking API allows clients to access liquid tokens in a seamless way.

Liquid staking token eliminates the need for users to lock up their assets for an extended period, providing greater flexibility and liquidity. Our platform will provide enterprises with access to liquid staking, allowing them to stake their assets and use them for other purposes simultaneously.

We have created individual API documentation for each LSD:
